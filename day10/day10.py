# rough approach: accept the lines as input, then turn this into a graph where each node leads to its uphill neighbours
# because each path has a maximum length of 10, there's a fairly easy way of solving part 1 - simply do 10 iterations over the data, starting with just the 9s, and iterate back until you have 0s
# if we no longer require it to be uphill (maybe part 2?) then we want to instead spread outwards from the 9s until the entire graph is covered
# i.e. the 9s are already considered nodes, then you can proceed outwards by either DFS or BFS, ignoring any nodes from which that 9 was already reachable
# since there's a reasonable chance of this, let's define the problem such that we can change what makes nodes adjacent
